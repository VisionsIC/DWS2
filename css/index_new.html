        Some may argue the fact that Baseball is our true American past-time. I may be opinionated when I state this, football <em>is</em> a true American past-time. I originally planned to talk about New York Giant's rookie wide receiver Odell Beckham's amazing catch against the Dallas Cowboys a few weeks ago. The pure skill he displayed to make that catch was unbelievable! But, after last night, the classic <em><strong>Iron Bowl</strong></em> rivalry game between Auburn and Alabama that lived up to the hype.

        	<p>If you ever get the opportunity to watch the early 1986 movie <em><strong>Wildcats </strong></em>which starred actress<em> Goldie Hawn. Wildcats </em>theme song was a rap by famed Rapper and actor <em>LL Cool J</em> that started with a verse:

        		<!--Rap Lyrics BLOCKQUOTE-->

        	<p>In closing this introductary section of the topic of football as a true <em>great </em>American sport, I have to encourage those who are curious, but don't understand it, to sit down and take it in for all that it is. The history, phandom, and passion of football await you as you begin your journey.

            	<p>The distant memories of being under the lights on Friday nights at my high school football games is part of the tradition of football. Some would say I'm crazy, but I miss the hard work of two-a-days. I can still remember the smell of the turf/grass. Pep rallies and homecoming weekend was always a special time I hold dear in my heart.

        		<p>As I look at football at the pro level, there is only one player I have total admiration for, <em>Brian Dawkins</em>. <strong>Weapon X</strong> has terrorized opponants for 16 seasons before retiring. He still remains one of the best players at the Safety position. Safety is the position I played in high school. This is why, in part, I carry a loyalty to #20!
